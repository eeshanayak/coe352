# Homework 3: Leapfrog Method

## Contents
1. Jupyter Notebook
*In this file, we can see the plots without having to run the program

2. Python3 File
*Run with:
```python3 Homework3LeapFrog.py```
When you run this program, the same figures as the Jupyter Notebook will be generated. 

The error plot looks quadratic which makes sense because the Leap Frog method i second-order accurate
